# This is the client react web application for the FindTime App
The problem this project aims to solve is that of finding a time to schedule a meeting or event or anything else that needs to be coordinated amongst several people.
### How it will work
Users will be able to create an account with an email and password. From there users will be able to create events and invite other people to their event. Users will be able to set their availability that will be used by the application to show available times for the event that work best for all or as many invited members as possible.

### Why I am working on this project
This project is simply a personal project to give me a challenge that requires learning more about creating a REST API and client specifically with react and express.
